[Test out Asteroids here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aliceFung/assignment_js_oop/master/asteroids.html)
###To Play:
- Use left and right arrow keys to rotate ship
- Press up arrow key to accelerate the ship
- To fire, hit the spacebar

###In this (super easy) version, beware:
- Your ship will float off into unknown space (offscreen) if you don't control it well. But, you can navigate it back into charted space territories.
- Your ship has special intangibility cloak (asteroids will not damage it).
- You have unlimited firepower.
- There are no points. Blast away!
